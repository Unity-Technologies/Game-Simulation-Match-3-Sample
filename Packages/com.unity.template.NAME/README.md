# Template repository for new Microgames

This readme is required to exist by the Package Validation Suite. You can use this file as you seem fit.
For Microgames this file is currently used by having some brief documenation here and then this file is
copied by the CI to the project's `Assets` folder as currently the package information/documentation is
lost when creating a new project using this template package.

The actual documentation for the package/template should be written in the `Documentation~` folder.
