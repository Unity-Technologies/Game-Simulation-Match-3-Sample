// |[About this file]
// |    - This is a 'living document' and will be updated as our standard evolves.
// |    - For best rendering, be sure to view this file in your text editor rather than through a web site source viewer.
// |    - The '// |'-style comments denote documentation markup, and are not part of the actual sample.
// |    - To avoid redundancy, rules inline in the reference code are only mentioned once. Assume they apply generally unless noted, or if obvious from the context.
// |    - This code is only intended to demonstrate conventions, and as a result sometimes gets nonsensical. Pay no attention to the substance, only the form.
// |    - Reasoning behind rules are not included here to save space. Ask on Q or browse 'code-conventions + c#' at https://q.unity3d.com/search.html?f=&type=question&redirect=search%2Fsearch&sort=relevance&q=%5Bcode-conventions%5D+and+%5Bc%23%5D.
// |    - This code will always compile cleanly as a Unity script and will show as fully green in ReSharper using the Unity rule set.
// |    - This file is currently maintained by scobi and lives in https://ono.unity3d.com/unity-extra/unity-meta/raw/@/ReferenceSource/CSharp/Assets/CSharpReference.cs.
// |    - For clarification, or reporting of ambiguities or bugs, ask on Q or #devs-code-conventions in Slack.
// |    - If you are writing C# intended for the Unity runtime (like UnityEngine.dll) then also read up on https://q.unity3d.com/questions/1814/what-should-i-consider-when-writing-c-code-that-wi.html
// |
// |[General]
// |    - Our standard extends Microsoft's Framework Design Guidelines, which defines a number of rules not covered by this document. (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/).
// |    - This document inlcludes a subset of the most used rules as well as any additions and exceptions to the FDG.
// |    - If there is any disagreement between this file and the FDG, this file always wins. Exceptions to the FDG are marked with [FDG Exception]
// |    - If the compiler does not require something, leave it out (i.e. 'this.' prefix, default access levels, 'Attribute' postfix, etc.)
// |
// |[Encoding]
// |    - Text file encoding is UTF8 with no BOM, using LF (unix) line endings.
// |    - 4-wide tabstops, using spaces only (no tab characters)
// |    - No trailing whitespace on lines, but always include a single newline at the end of the file.
// |    - (All of the above are ensured by a combination of automated tools. Make sure you have followed the setup instructions at http://confluence.hq.unity3d.com/x/ooPD.)
// |
// |[Files]
// |    - No file header, copyright, etc. of any kind. Some IDE's may add them automatically - please remove them.
// |    - Maintain the style of surrounding code if it has its own separate standard (i.e. is or heavily derived from external).
// |    - Use PascalCase for file names, typically matching the name of the dominant type in the file (or if none is dominant, use a reasonable category name).
// |
// |[Naming]
// |    - Use PascalCase for all symbol names, except where noted.
// |    - No 'Hungarian notation' or other prefixes, except where noted.
// |    - Spell words using correct US-English spelling. Note that there are a few legacy exceptions that use GB-English that we must preserve, but do not add new ones.
// |    - Use descriptive and accurate names, even if it makes them longer. Favor readability over brevity.
// |    - Avoid abbreviations when possible unless the abbreviation is commonly accepted.
// |    - Acronyms are PascalCase, unless they are exactly two letters, in which case they are UPPERCASE. (ex. htmlText, GetCpuCycles(), IOStream)
// |    - Do not capitalize each word in so-called closed-form compound words (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions for a sample list of compound words)
// |    - Use semantically interesting names rather than language-specific keywords for type names (i.e. GetLength > GetInt).
// |    - Use a common name, such as value/item/element, rather than repeating the type name, in the rare cases when an identifier has no semantic meaning and the type is not important (i.e. newElements > newInts).
// |
// |    Type Naming:
// |        - Make type names unambiguous across namespaces and problem domains by avoiding common terms or adding a prefix or a suffix. (ex. use 'PhysicsSolver', not 'Solver')
// |        - Avoid unnecessary prefixes/suffixes, even when other types in the namespace have a prefix (ex. use 'LightEstimationData', not 'ARLightEstimationData', even though 'ARSession' exists)
// |        - Avoid naming types after terms that represent different concepts in different domains (ex. use 'AndroidInput', not 'Input')
// |        - Do not use namespaces to enable reusing an existing type name, as resolving conflicts in user code requires using aliases or fully qualified type names.
// |
// |    Methods and Parameters:
// |        - When a method takes one or more arguments that imply a binary condition, consider the following options:
// |            - If the method name clearly conveys a binary condition, then use a bool argument (e.g., void SetActive(bool active))
// |            - If the method name conveys a condition that could conceivably have more than two states:
// |                - You can create multiple named method variants (e.g., void Repaint() and void RepaintImmediately(), T GetComponent() and T GetComponentReadOnly()).
// |                    (+) Avoids adding new enumerated type to the API surface.
// |                    (-) Increases number of named methods (and thus number of search points in API reference).
// |                    (-) API surface will grow if support for new modes is added later.
// |                - You can create a single method and add an enum for the condition (e.g., void ApplyChanges(InteractionMode mode = InteractionMode.UserAction)).
// |                    (+) More robust to future support of additional modes.
// |                    (+) Single named API point communicates common intent, parameter conveys implementation/execution details.
// |                    (-) Adds more enumerated types to the API, which may not be widely used.
// |        - In other cases, prefer overloads rather than additional methods with different names (e.g., void GetItems(List<T> items) and void GetItems(T[] items, int length) instead of void GetItemsDynamic(List<T> items) and void GetItemsPreAllocated(T[] items, int length)).
// |        - Give careful consideration to method parameter names. Users can invoke methods using named parameters, and the API updater currently cannot fix these usages.
// |
// |    Definitions:
// |        - camelCase: words* capitalized, except the first (see the humps?)
// |        - PascalCase: all words* capitalized
// |        - UPPERCASE: all letters in all words* capitalized
// |        * A "word" may only contain letters and numbers (no underscores or other symbols).
// |
// |    Readability examples:
// |        - HorizontalAlignment instead of AlignmentHorizontal (more English-readable)
// |        - CanScrollHorizontally instead of ScrollableX ('x' is somewhat obscure reference to the x axis)
// |        - DirectionalVector instead of DirVec (unnecessary and use of nonstandard abbreviation)
// |
// |    Common abbreviations:
// |        - param (parameter), arg (argument), id (identifier), db (database), ok (okay)
// |
// |[Spacing]
// |    - Space before opening parenthesis?
// |        - If it looks like a function call, no space (function calls, function definitions, typeof(), sizeof())
// |        - If it opens a scope, add a space (if, while, catch, switch, for, foreach, using, lock, fixed)
// |    - No spaces immediately inside any parens or brackets (e.g. no 'if ( foo )' or 'x = ( y * z[ 123 ] )')
// |    - Comma and semicolon spacing as in English ('int a, float b' and 'for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)')
// |    - Exactly one space is required after the // in a C++ style comment.
// |    - Do not add a space between a unary operator and its operand (!expr, +30, -1.4, i++, --j, &expr, *expr, (int)obj, etc.).
// |    - Do not add spaces around member access operators (a.b, a->b, etc.).
// |    - Spaces are required both before and after all other operators (math, assignment, comparison, lambdas, etc.).
// |
// |[Wrapping]
// |    - Wrap code once it gets to around 120 columns wide to keep side-by-side diffs sane (not a hard limit; use your judgment).
// |    - When necessary, break lines after boolean operators in conditional expressions, after ';' in for-statements, and after ',' in function calls
// |
// |[Comments]
// |    - Documenting the 'why' is far more important than the 'what' or 'how'.
// |    - Document anything that would surprise another engineer (or yourself in six months when you've forgotten it).
// |    - /*C-Style comments*/ are not permitted. They are reserved for commenting out big hunks of code locally (never to be committed).
// |    - No "divider" comments (i.e. long ----- and ////// comments just to break up code).
// |    - No "category" comments (i.e. // Functions  // Private Data  // Globals etc.).
// |    - Use of #region is _always_ disallowed.
// |    - Only use /// (triple slash) comments if you are writing xmldoc, and never for ordinary comments that you want to stand out
// |________________________________________________________________________________________________

// |[Usings]
// |    - Located at file scope at the top of the file, never within a namespace.
// |    - Three groups, which are, top to bottom: System, non-System, aliases. Keep each group sorted.
// |    - Strip unused 'usings' except the 'minimally-required set', which is marked with *required below.
// |    - Only use aliases when required by the compiler for disambiguation, and not for hiding rarely-used symbols behind a prefix.
// |    - Always drop explicit namespace qualifications on types when a 'using' can be added (i.e. almost all of the time).
